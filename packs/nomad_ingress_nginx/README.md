# Nomad Ingress Nginx

This pack deploys an Nginx reverse proxy that is automatically configured to
handle traffic ingress to allocations based on service meta values and tags.

Jobs can register themselves in the ingress by annotating their services either
using `tags` or `meta` values.

```hcl
service {
  name = "webapp"
  port = "http"

  tags = [
    "nomad_ingress_enabled=true",
    "nomad_ingress_hostname=webapp.example.com",
  ]
}
```

```hcl
service {
  name = "webapp"
  port = "http"

  meta {
    nomad_ingress_enabled  = true
    nomad_ingress_hostname = "webapp.example.com"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

This pack requires a client with Docker installed and a working Consul cluster.

## Getting started

Start a local Nomad and Consul agent. If you are not on Linux, refer to this
[FAQ entry][nomad_docs_faq] so your containers can communicate properly.

The Nginx ingress can use hostnames to route requests to the appropriate
allocations. When testing locally, you can add entries to your `/etc/hosts` file
to simulate entries in a DNS.

In this example, you will use the [`fake-service`] sample app, so add an entry
like this to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
<YOUR_IP> fake.example.com
```

If you are on Linux you can set `<YOUR_IP>` to `127.0.0.1`, otherwise use the IP
address defined in your Consul agent `-bind` configuration from the previous
step.

When you access `fake.example.com` your system will resolve this hostname to
your own IP address.

Run the Nginx ingress pack:

```shell-session
$ nomad-pack run nomad_ingress_nginx
```

Next, copy this sample `fake-service` job into a file called
`fake-service.nomad` and run it:

```hcl
job "fake-service" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "fake-service" {
    count = 3

    network {
      port "http" {}
    }

    service {
      name = "fake-service"
      port = "http"
    }

    task "fake-service" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "nicholasjackson/fake-service:v0.22.7"
        ports = ["http"]
      }

      env {
        LISTEN_ADDR = "0.0.0.0:${NOMAD_PORT_http}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```shell-session
$ nomad run fake-service.nomad
```

Without an ingress it's hard to access this application, since each allocation
will have its own IP and port. That's where the ingress comes handy.

#### Hostname ingress

Update the `fake-service` job to add some `meta` values to the service and run
the job again:

```diff
job "fake_service" {
  # ...
  group "fake-service" {
    # ...
    service {
      name = "fake-service"
      port = "http"

+     meta {
+       nomad_ingress_enabled  = true
+       nomad_ingress_hostname = "fake.example.com"
+     }
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

```shell-session
$ nomad run fake-service.nomad
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://fake.example.com and verify that your
app is reachable.

#### Path ingress

You can also route traffic using a specifc URL path. Update the service of
`fake-service` like this:

```diff
job "fake_service" {
  # ...
  group "fake-service" {
    # ...
    service {
      name = "fake-service"
      port = "http"

      meta {
        nomad_ingress_enabled  = true
-       nomad_ingress_hostname = "fake.example.com"
+       nomad_ingress_path     = "/fake"
      }
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://<YOUR_IP>/fake` and verify that your
app is reachable using a path now.

#### Port ingress

Another option is to access services using different ports. This requires
reconfiguring the `nomad_ingress_nginx` pack instance deployed earlier to
include additional ports:

```shell-session
$ nomad-pack run -var 'nginx_extra_ports=[{name: "fake-service", port: 8080, host_network: ""}]' nomad_ingress_nginx
```

Update the `fake-service` job so that it uses the new port:

```diff
job "fake_service" {
  # ...
  group "fake-service" {
    # ...
    service {
      name = "fake-service"
      port = "http"

      meta {
        nomad_ingress_enabled = true
-       nomad_ingress_path    = "/fake"
+       nomad_ingress_port    = "8080"
      }
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://<YOUR_IP>:8080` and verify that your
app is reachable using the new port.
