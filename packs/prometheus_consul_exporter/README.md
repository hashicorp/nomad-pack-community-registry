# Prometheus Consul Exporter

This pack contains a single job that runs
[Prometheus Consul Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/consul_exporter) as a service job. It
currently supports being run by the [Docker driver](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker).

The Consul exporter task registers a Consul service and health check by default. Once running, your
Prometheus configuration can be updated with the following scrape config entry example which will
allow Prometheus to discover and scrape all deployed Consul exporter instances.
```yaml
- job_name: "consul_exporter"
  metrics_path: "/metrics"
  consul_sd_configs:
    - server: "consul.example.com:8500"
      services:
        - "prometheus-consul-exporter"
```

## Variables

- `job_name` (string "") - The name to use as the job name which overrides using the pack name.
- `datacenters` (list(string) ["dc1"]) - A list of datacenters in the region which are eligible for
  task placement.
- `region` (string "global") - The region where the job should be placed.
- `namespace` (string "default") - The namespace where the job should be placed.
- `constraints` (list(object)) - Constraints to apply to the entire job.
- `consul_exporter_group_network` (object) - The Consul exporter network configuration options.
- `consul_exporter_task_config` (object) - The Consul exporter task config options.
- `consul_exporter_task_resources` (object) - The resource to assign to the Consul exporter task.
- `consul_exporter_task_services` (object) - Configuration options of the Consul exporter services
and checks.

### `constraints` List of Objects

[Nomad job specification constraints][job_constraint] allows restricting the set of eligible nodes
on which the Prometheus Consul Exporter task will run.

- `attribute` (string) - Specifies the name or reference of the attribute to examine for the
  constraint.
- `operator` (string) - Specifies the comparison operator. The ordering is compared lexically.
- `value` (string) - Specifies the value to compare the attribute against using the specified
  operation.

The default value constrains the job to run on client whose kernel name is `linux`. The HCL
variable list of objects is shown below and uses a double dollar sign for escaping:
```hcl
[
  {
    attribute = "$${attr.kernel.name}",
    value     = "linux",
    operator  = "",
  }
]
```

### `consul_exporter_group_network` Object

- `mode` (string "bridge") - Mode of the network.
- `ports` (map<string|number> http:9107) - Specifies the port mapping for the Consul exporter task.

### `consul_exporter_task_config` Object

- `version` (string "v0.7.1") - The Prometheus Consul Exporter version to run.
- `cli_args` (list(string) []) - CLI arguments to pass to the Consul Exporter app.

### `consul_exporter_task_resources` Object

-`cpu` (number 100) - Specifies the CPU required to run this task in MHz.
-`memory` (number 128) - Specifies the memory required in MB.

### `consul_exporter_task_services` List of Objects

- `service_port_label` (string) - Specifies the port to advertise for this service.
- `service_name` (string) - Specifies the name this service will be advertised as in Consul.
- `service_tags` (list(string)) - Specifies the list of tags to associate with this service.
- `check_enabled` (bool) - Whether to enable a check for this service.
- `check_path` (string) - Specifies the path of the HTTP endpoint which Consul will query to query
the health of a service.
- `check_type` (string) - The type of check to configure.
- `check_interval` (string) - Specifies the frequency of the health checks that Consul will perform.
- `check_timeout` (string)-  Specifies how long Consul will wait for a health check query to succeed.

The default value for this variable configures a service and a check for the Consul exporter `http`
port defined as default within the `consul_exporter_group_network.ports` mapping.
