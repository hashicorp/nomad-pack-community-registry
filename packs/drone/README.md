# Drone

This pack can be used to run [Drone](https://drone.io) server and Drone agent on your Nomad cluster. It currently supports being run by the [Docker](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker), and is configured by environment variables.

In order to launch Drone, you must provide credentials to your Source Control Management provider of choice. Click on the version control
system you want to use, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, in the [Drone Documentation](https://readme.drone.io/server/overview/) for
more information on which environment variables to provide. These environment variables should be set in `drone_server_cfg` and `drone_agent_cfg`.
