# Redis -- Standalone Instance

This pack runs [Redis](https://redis.io) as a standalone instance using the Nomad [service](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers#service) scheduler. The service runs as a Docker container using the [Docker](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker) driver.

This is a standalone instance of Redis. To deploy Redis in a cluster, use <insert link to redis-clustered pack -- TBD>

Default (Vanilla) Installation:
- [Protected Mode](https://redis.io/topics/security#protected-mode) is disabled by default.
- No volumes are attached. All data are stored in the container's `/data` directory. To learn more about persisted storage, see [Persisting Storage](#persisting-storage) below.
- The container uses the default Redis configuration as specified [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/redis).
- By default, a snapshot is automatically created as `/data/dump.rdb` when the following are true:
  - After 3600 seconds (an hour) if at least 1 key changed
  - After 300 seconds (5 minutes) if at least 100 keys changed
  - After 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed

## Persisting Storage

In most production cases, you will need to deploy Redis while using persisted storage for data backup and restoration. Additionally, you may also want to deploy Redis using your own configuration file.

### Using Host Volume
If you wish to utilize Nomad's host volume for Redis data, you must have the following in place:

1. The directory that will be used exists on the Nomad host(s)
2. The host volume block is added in the Nomad client configuration, as specified [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/stateful-workloads-host-volumes#configure-the-client)
```hcl
client {
  host_volume "redis" {
    path      = "/path/to/volume"
    read_only = false
  }
}
```

3. The `use_host_volume` variable is set to `true`
```
--var use_host_volume=true
```

4. (Optional) The name of the volume is set using the `redis_volume` variable. Default is `redis`
```
--var redis_volume=<volume name>
```

Nomad will mount the host volume into the default `/data` directory within the container.

## Example Usage
```
nomad-pack run redis --var job_name="redis-standalone" --var use_host_volume=true --var image="redis:6.2.6"
```
